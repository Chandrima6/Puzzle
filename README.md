# Puzzle

- This is a Puzzle web app implemented using ES6, HTML5, CSS, flex-box as layout model.

- This app is responsive with 1 breakpoint (width: 375px) greater than it have the grid view and lesser than it have the columnar view.

- Number of puzzle blocks, data in it and classNames for styling them can be passed based on user preference as implemented in app.js using the constant 'puzzleObj'

- I am using private class method identifier of ES10. Since this is a new feature, minimum Chrome version should be 84 and this will not work in safari and IE.

## Note

- This can also be implemented using a javascript framework/ library like React, Angular but since it is mentioned to implement without any framework/ library so opted for Javascript versions. 

- I have not added any unit tests. Could be added to test different input for 'puzzleObj' variable and test the behaviour.
